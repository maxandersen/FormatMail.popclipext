Format Mail 
===========

Format Mail extension for PopClip.

Intended use is to format paragraphs to be more readable in mails
by reformatting it so no text goes beyond 79 characters - and without
breaking up common text formatting like markdown or asciidoc.

It relies on [par](http://www.nicemice.net/par/) being installed.

If you do not have `par` installed you can do that by running `brew install par`.
