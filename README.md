Format Mail 
===========

Format Paragraph extension for PopClip.

Mainly intended use is to format paragraphs to be more readable in mails
by reformatting it so no text goes beyond 79 characters.

It relies on [par](http://www.nicemice.net/par/) being installed.

If you do not have `par` installed you can do that by running `brew install par`.
